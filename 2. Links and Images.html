    <p>The below mentioned links opens in the same tag</p>

    <a href="https://google.com">Go to Google </a><br>
    <a href="https://facebook.com">Go to Facebook </a><br>
    <a href="https://twitter.com">Go to Twitter </a><br>

    <!-- But when we do this the Link opens but Opens in the Same Browser. We want it to open in another browser. So we use another attribute target   -->
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p>The Below Mentioned Links opens in a new tab</p>

    <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Go to Google</a><br>
    <a href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank"> Go to Facebook</a> </a><br>
    <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank"> Go to Twitter </a><br>

    <p>We can also add links to our previous Works by using a /</p>
    <a href="/tut4.html" target="_blank"> Tut 4</a>

    <br><br>
    Alt shows the Alternate Text it will show if due to some reason the Image isn't loaded
    In src we have to give the Link to the image or if in the system , preffer it is in the same folder else give the
    Complete path of the Image
    <br><br>

    Image is not added therefore it is showing the Alternate message <br>
    <img src="Deepanshu.jpeg" alt="Image of Deeepanshu Can't load">

    <br><br>
    Width and Height tags are also available but we will not use beacuse we will do it with the help of CSS.
